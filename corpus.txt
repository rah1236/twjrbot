moral of the story: don‚Äôt flirt with out of state guys unless they‚Äôre nice and don‚Äôt send dry ass texts ü•¥ü•¥

Had another case of the good ol‚Äô insomnia. But today should be good! I‚Äôm listening to British radio and being productive! üêÄ
Since Dylan Jones is nocturnal now he probably hangs out with russian twitter
but alas, flirting with guys that live over 10 miles from me leads to nothing üòíüòí
HE CALLED me pretty brb blushing
random guy from Minnesota hit me up in the DM‚Äôs, brb flirting with no endgoal
